## Features

- Real-time feedback on your guessed letters.
- Randomly selected hidden words for each game.

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Start guessing letters to find the hidden word.
3. Enter a letter by typing it on your keyboard.
4. Press the "Enter" key to submit your guess.
5. Green cells indicate correct letters in the correct positions.
6. Yellow cells indicate correct letters in the wrong positions.
7. Gray cells indicate incorrect letters.
8. You have six attempts to guess the word correctly.
